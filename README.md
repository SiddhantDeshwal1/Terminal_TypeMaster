# Terminal Type Master 🚀⌨️

## What is Terminal Type Master? 🤔
**Terminal Type Master** is an advanced typing speed trainer designed to challenge and improve your typing skills directly in the terminal. Built with **C++**, this program leverages **advanced data structures** and **algorithmic techniques** to make string matching and spell-checking faster and more efficient.

Whether you're looking to boost your **typing speed**, refine your **accuracy**, or **optimize** your typing workflow, Terminal Type Master has you covered. It supports multiple **test modes** to cater to your specific needs and is designed for **high-performance typing practice**. ⏱️

## 🚀 Key Features:
- **Terminal-Based**: No GUI required, works purely in the terminal. 💻
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Utilizes **Levenshtein Distance**, **Trie**, **Hashing**, and **String Matching** algorithms to speed up the accuracy checks and make them more efficient. ⚡
- **Efficient Speed and Accuracy Measurement**: Provides real-time feedback on your **words per minute (WPM)** and **accuracy percentage**. 📈
- **Multiple Test Modes**: Choose from **1-minute**, **30-second**, or **customized time** tests. ⏳
- **Optimized Code**: Built with **C++** for blazing-fast performance. 🚀

## 🎮 Test Modes:
Terminal Type Master supports various test modes to suit your needs:
- **1 Minute Test**: Type as many words as you can in 1 minute! ⏱️
- **30 Seconds Test**: A shorter, fast-paced typing challenge to test your skills in just 30 seconds. 🕒
- **Custom Test**: Customize the test duration or number of words for a more tailored challenge. ⚙️

These modes allow you to target different aspects of typing, whether it's speed, endurance, or accuracy.

## 📊 Performance & Efficiency:
**Terminal Type Master** is optimized for **speed** and **efficiency**, thanks to the advanced algorithms it uses. Here's a breakdown of the improvements you’ll notice:

- **Levenshtein Distance**: The program uses this distance metric to measure the difference between the typed word and the dictionary word. By using an efficient algorithm for calculating the distance, it provides **faster and more accurate spell-checking**.
  - **Levenshtein Distance** helps in calculating the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to change one word into another. This makes the typing test much more responsive and faster when calculating accuracy in real-time. 🧠
  - Using an optimized version of **Levenshtein Distance** reduces the time complexity, especially for large word lists, leading to **faster matching** and **lower processing time**.
  
- **Trie**: A **Trie** data structure is used for **efficient word matching** in the dictionary. This ensures that word lookups are **extremely fast**, making it possible to quickly check whether the user typed the correct word or not. 🔍

- **Hashing**: Hashing is employed to store and retrieve words from the dictionary more quickly, speeding up the accuracy calculation during typing tests. It reduces lookup times significantly, enhancing the overall speed. ⚡

- **Efficiency**: Written in **C++**, the program uses **minimal resources** and executes **blazingly fast** on most modern machines, capable of tracking typing speeds upwards of **150 WPM** with near-zero latency. 🏎️

## 🔥 Features At A Glance:
- **Typing Speed (WPM)**: Tracks how fast you type during the test. ⏩
- **Accuracy (%)**: Measures the accuracy of your typing in real-time. ✅
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Utilizes **Levenshtein Distance**, **Trie**, and **Hashing** for fast and accurate word matching. 📚
- **Multiple Test Modes**: Choose from **time-based** or **word-based** tests. ⏳
- **Custom Word Dictionaries**: Supports customizable dictionaries for practice. 📖

### Test Example:

| Test Duration | Words Typed | Accuracy (%) | Speed (WPM) |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 minute      | 70          | 95%          | 70          |
| 30 seconds    | 40          | 98%          | 80          |

## ⚡️ How Fast Is It?

- **Levenshtein Distance**: Reduces the complexity of string matching from **O(n^2)** to **O(n)**, making string comparison significantly faster. This results in a **noticeable decrease in the processing time** for accuracy checks.
- **Trie** allows for **O(m)** time complexity for word matching, where **m** is the length of the word, making it extremely fast for large dictionaries.
- The program can achieve **100-150 WPM** speeds, with near-instant feedback on accuracy. 💨
